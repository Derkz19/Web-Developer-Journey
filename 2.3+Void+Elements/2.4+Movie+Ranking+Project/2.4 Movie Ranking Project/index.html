<h3>Re:Zero</h3>
<p>This show really hooked me in the world of Anime. I love the character development of this show especially the mc.
It really shows how one action really affects the events in the story, what would happen if its taken in another route.</p>
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>So many stories, action, comedy and drama in one anime, this show really inspires me and never stop chasing my dream</p>
<h3>Your Lie in April</h3>
<p>My very first anime that made me cry. Especially the last one huhu yawa</p>
